# Danfixx-Watson

Inspired by this: https://github.com/VidyasagarMSC/WatBot.
An Android application was developed as a proof of concept during the Semester Project: Danfixx
of the 3rd semester in ICTE in Aalborg University Copenhagen, 2016.

A Bot was created incorporating Watson Cognitive Services, Conversation API and Text-to-Speech API.
Google Maps and Geofence functionalities were also included.
